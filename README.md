# ProbeHunter
Open-source wireless reconnaisance platform based off the ESP8266 WiFi microcontroller in an easy to assembly kit.
### About
This device was initially designed to trilaterate a device's location, detecting probe requests emitted over WiFi. 
I designed a modular hardware platform based off the ESP8266 microcontroller that allows it to support other custom software you can code, for instance wardriving.
The ProbeHunter design also uses easy to come by, mostly through-hole parts that make this a good beginner hardware assembly kit.
More updates to this repo coming soon when I have more time to develop the platform.
